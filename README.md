# Loan_Eligibility_prediction_using_machinelearning

The task of this machine learning project is to train the model for accepting or rejecting a loan. Now there are 3 models wherein we can train the model and test it to predict whether other applicants could get loan or not.

First model is about using logistic regression model for which the accuracy is 0.8373 and accuracy using k-fold cross validation comes to 0.8024.

Second model gives 0.6910 accuracy and 0.7148 accuracy using k-fold cross validation.

Third model gives 0.8292 and 0.7922 as accuracies.

Among all the models, Logistic regression gives better accuracy. This Logistic regression model has been trained with a datasets and tested with another dataset.
